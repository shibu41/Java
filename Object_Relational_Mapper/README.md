# _Object Relational Mapper_

This is a basic object relational mapper. Currently, it only supports read and write operations.

## Key features

- Uses Java Reflection API
- This JavaORM maps Java objects to database tables, automatically generating SQL queries and handling the mapping between object fields and database columns.
- Uses in-build H2 database to store data.
- Uses the concept of Annotations.


## How to use

At first, download and extract the whole project in new folder and open the project in any IDE of choice. Then expand the project structure and under package or folder named "main", there are two files- "WritingObjects.java" and "ReadingObjects.java".

- The "WritingObjects.java" file can be used to enter a new entity in the database. I have also provided some examples entities.
- The "ReadingObjects.java" file can be used to read the previously entered data from the database.

Any further suggestion will be of great importance.  
Thank You.
